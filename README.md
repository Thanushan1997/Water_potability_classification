# Water_potability_classification

The main objective of this analysis is to build a model to predict the potability of water of a
resource using water quality metrics.It is also interested in finding out which factors affect the
most for the potability of the water. The dataset consists of data of 3276 different water bodies
collected on 10 water quality metrics including the response variable. The descriptive analysis
showed that pH value, amount of sulfate, amount of chloramines, and the number of
trihalomethanes affect the potability of the water than other factors. Also, some relationships
between the water quality metrics have been revealed. Advanced analysis was done by fitting
classification techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest,
and XG-Boost in two different ways. The first way was carried out by changing certain numerical
variables to categories and the other way was carried out by taking the numerical values directly.
